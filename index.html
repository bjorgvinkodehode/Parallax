      <h2>Dimmuborgir</h2>
      <p>
        Dimmuborgir dimmu "dark", borgir "cities" or "forts", "castles"; Dimmuborgir is a large area of unusually shaped lava fields east of Mývatn in Iceland. 
        The Dimmuborgir area is composed of various volcanic caves and rock formations, reminiscent of an ancient collapsed citadel hence the name. 
        The dramatic structures are one of Iceland's most popular natural tourist attractions.
        The Dimmuborgir area consists of a massive, collapsed lava tube formed by a lava lake flowing in from a large eruption in the Þrengslaborgir and Lúdentsborgir 
        crater row to the East, about 2300 years ago. At Dimmuborgir, the lava pooled over a small lake. As the lava flowed across the wet sod, the water of the marsh 
        started to boil, the vapour rising through the lava forming lava pillars from drainpipe size up to several meters in diameter.As the lava continued flowing
        towards lower ground in the Mývatn area, the top crust collapsed, but the hollow pillars of solidified lava remained. The lava lake must have been at least 
        10 meters deep, as estimated by the tallest structures still standing.
        The lava flow surface remains partly intact around the Dimmuborgir area, so that the Dimmuborgir itself sits below the surrounding surface area. 
        The area is characterised by large hollow cell- or chamber-like structures formed around bubbles of vapour, and some dramatically standing lava pillars.
        Several of the chambers and pillar bases are large enough to house humans, giving rise to the term "castles" (borgir).

      <h2>Flateyjardalur</h2>
      <p>
        Flateyjardalur is a deserted valley in northern Iceland on the Flateyjarskagi peninsula. 
        The valley stretches north from the Fnjóskadalur valley up to the Skjálfandi bay. 
        Flateyjardalur is named after the island of Flatey, which lies just off the coast. 
        Finnboga saga ramma, one of the Icelandic sagas, takes place in the valley. 
        The last inhabitants left the valley in 1953. That same year, 
        a road was built from Fnjóskadalur to Flateyjardalur connecting the valley to other parts of the region. 
        There are three concrete houses in the valley which were built in the late 1920s. 
        Today, these houses are only inhabited seasonally during the summer months.

      <h2>Surtshellir</h2>
      <p>
        Surtshellir is a lava cave located in western Iceland, around 60 km from the settlement of Borgarnes.
        Approximately a mile in length, it is one of the longest such caves in the country. 
        It was the first known lava tube in the world, at least by modern speleologists, and remained the longest known lava tube until the end of the 19th century.
         While mentioned in the medieval historical-geographical work Landnámabók, 
        Eggert Ólafsson was the first to give a thorough documentation of the cave in his 1750 travels of the region. 
        It is named after the fire giant Surtr, a prominent figure in Norse mythology, who is prophesied to one day engulf the world in the fire of his flaming sword.
        Surtshellir was formed as a lava tube in a massive, effusive, shield-volcano eruption at the northern end of the Prestahnúkur volcanic system.
        At least three and possibly four vents opened on the edge of Langjökull glacier during this long-lived eruption, 
        which has been dated to the first decades of Iceland's settlement (c. 880-920) Ultimately,
        the eruption covered 240 km2 (90 mi2) of once fertile grazing and settled land beneath sheets of lava 20 meters thick,
        or more. Surtshellir is one of 20 known caves in the Hallmundarhraun lava field that once carried magma from the vents 
        to the farthest ends of the lava field, more than 50 km to the west. Eight of these (including Viðgelmir and Hallmundarhellir)
        are known to contain archaeological remains of varying age; Surtshellir's are the most extensive.

      <h2>Landmannalaugar</h2>
      <p>
        Landmannalaguar is a wild and stunning area in the Iceland highlands. 
        Set in a dramatic location on the edge of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge it’s one of the most interesting places to visit in Iceland.
        Situated within a massive caldera, the volcanic eruption that formed the area released rhyolite lava, rather than the much more common basalt.
         The result is an area of sweeping colourful mountains stained a burnt orange and red hue; sandy-coloured gravel cut by glacial rivers and bubbling mud pots within steely-black lava fields.
        The striking array of contrasting colours and shapes provides the setting for some of the best hiking in Iceland. 
        Trails cross canyons and over narrow ridges; each turn offering remarkable views and abundant photographic opportunities.

        <h2>Dettifoss</h2>
        <p>
            Dettifoss is a waterfall in Vatnajökull National Park in Northeast Iceland, 
            and is reputed to be the second most powerful waterfall in Europe after the Rhine Falls.
            Dettifoss is situated on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum river, which flows from the Vatnajökull glacier and collects water from a large area in Northeast Iceland. 
            The sediment-rich runoff colours the water a greyish white.
            The falls are 100 metres (330 ft) wide and have a drop of 44 metres (144 ft) down to the canyon Jökulsárgljúfur. 
            It is the second largest waterfall in Iceland in terms of volume discharge (behind the Urriðafoss), having an average water flow of 193 m³/s. 
            The superlative of "most powerful" comes from its water flow times its fall distance.
